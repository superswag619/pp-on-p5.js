# pp-on-p5.js
I made a lot of pp's on p5.js

SO! Before you copy this into p5, here are some things to know:

1. When adding both .js files make sure that both are refrenced in the index.html file (style.css doesn't really matter)
2. Everything is labeled via comments

Now have fun making your profane shapes!
